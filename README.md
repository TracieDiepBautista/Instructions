# Science To A Changing World

Another Project using Javascript but this time to do geo-mapping with Leaflet.js...

    United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short. The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, 
    the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods 
    and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 
    - The task: helping USGS out with an building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. 
      They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. 
      Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government 
      organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
    
    The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.
    
    The steps by steps: from an HTML: 
    
    - Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude to
      reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color.
    - Layer controls to be added.
    - Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
